If they did, please feel free to add your additional thoughts to their original thread topic.</li> <li>Use A Clear Title Please make an effort to give your suggestion a title that concisely summarizes your suggestion. Your suggestion title should be able to convey what you'd like to see added or changed in the community while also avoiding overly broad or nondescript titles that extend beyond the scope of your suggestion.</li> <li>Avoid 'Bumping' If a suggestion has been posted, it means that it either has been or will be seen by the staff team at some point in time. Bumping topics for the sake of visibility isn't going to make our team read it twice but is rather going to drown out newly submitted suggestions from other members. It also disrupts the conversation within the suggestion thread if there is a \"bump\" message being posted routinely.</li> <li>Discussion Is Welcome Members are encouraged to engage in discussion with each other about suggestions and feedback. If you are not interested in having others weigh in on your suggestion, you can send your suggestion to ZeNinja864#6464 and they will create a thread for your suggestion.</li> <li>Be Respectful If you don't feel that you like or agree with another member's suggestion, feel free to voice that in their thread. If you are unable to voice your opinion in a respectful manner then it is kindly asked that you keep it to yourself.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"community/feedback/suggestions/#suggestion-review","title":"Suggestion Review","text":"<p>As mentioned, the staff team will read your suggestion when there is an appropriate time to do so; This typically occurs when a suggestion has become mature with enough feedback and discussion that it can be considered for implementation or is something rather simple to implement.

Stay tuned to the \ud83d\udce2 #Announcements channel in the Discord server for updates regarding accepted suggestions and other community news.</li> <li> Suggestion Pending  The suggestion is something that the staff team would like to possibly implement but there is something that needs to be addressed; A post will typically be made explaining what details or items are missing and the suggestion will be placed on the \"back-burner\" for review again in the future.</li> <li> Suggestion Denied  Suggestions may be denied for reasons can range from simply being impossible to implement to something that won't be done either in general or at the current time.
