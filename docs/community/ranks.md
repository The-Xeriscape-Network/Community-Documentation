# Member Ranks
Welcome to the ranks and roles section of our help center! In this article, we'll provide an overview of the different ranks and roles within our community, as well as explain the responsibilities and privileges associated with each rank. Understanding the ranks and roles within our community is important for all members, as it helps to ensure that everyone is aware of the expectations and responsibilities of their position. We hope this article helps to clarify any questions you may have about the ranks and roles within our community. Let's get started!

## Permission Roles

### üî∞ Initiate
Initiates are individuals who have joined the community but are currently unverified. Individuals must self-verify themselves in order to acquire the üéâ Member role and gain access to the greater Xeriscape community.

### üéâ Member
Members are individuals who have undergone a self-verification process and thereby gained access to the broader Xeriscape community. By self-verifying themselves, these individuals demonstrate their commitment and interest in participating in the community and its activities.

The self-verification process ensures that members align with the values, principles, and goals of the Xeriscape community. It serves as a means of establishing a sense of trust and accountability within the community, fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all members.

Once individuals have successfully completed the self-verification process, they become part of the larger Xeriscape community, where they can engage in discussions, share insights, exchange ideas, and contribute to the collective knowledge and growth of the community.

Being a member of the Xeriscape community provides individuals with opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, explore relevant topics, access exclusive resources, and actively participate in community initiatives. It is a recognition of their dedication and interest in the community as a whole.

## Vanity Roles
Vanity roles in the Xeriscape community serve as a purely-cosmetic means of recognizing members for the actions that they have taken in the community.

Achieving this rank requires an extended period of dedicated assistance to fellow community members, and it is a distinction rarely granted.
